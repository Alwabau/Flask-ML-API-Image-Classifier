# Flask ML API

## Basic service

On this project, we will code and deploy an API for serving our own machine learning models. For this particular case, it will be a Convolutional Neural Network for images.

Below is the full project structure:

```

│   ├── app.py
│   ├── middleware.py
│   ├── views.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── utils.py

│   │   └── index.html
│   └── tests

├── model

├── stress_test
│   └── locustfile.py
├── docker-compose.yml
├── README.md
└── tests
    └── test_integration.py
```

Let's take a quick overview on each module:

- api: It has all the needed code to implement the communication interface between the users and our service. It uses Flask and Redis to queue tasks to be processed by our machine learning model.
    - `api/app.py`: Setup and launch our Flask api.
    - `api/views.py`: Contains the API endpoints. You must implement the following endpoints:
        - *upload_image*: Displays a frontend in which the user can upload an image and get a prediction from our model.
        - *predict*: POST method which receives an image and sends back the model prediction. This endpoint is useful for integration with other services and platforms given we can access it from any other programming language.
        - *feedback*: Endpoint used to get feedback from users when the prediction from our model is incorrect.
    - `api/utils.py`: Implements some extra functions used internally by our api.
    - `api/settings.py`: It has all the API settings.
    - `api/templates`: Here we put the .html files used in the frontend.
    - `api/tests`: Test suite.
- model: Implements the logic to get jobs from Redis and process them with our Machine Learning model. When we get the predicted value from our model, we must encole it on Redis again so it can be delivered to the user.
    - `model/ml_service.py`: Runs a thread in which it get jobs from Redis, process them with the model and returns the answers.
    - `model/settings.py`: Settings for our ML model.
    - `model/tests`: Test suite.
- tests: This module contains integration tests so we can properly check our system end-to-end behavior is the expected.

The communication between our services (*api* and *model*) will be done using *Redis*. Every time *api* wants to process an image, it will store the image on disk and send the image name through Redis to the *model* service. *model* already knows in which folder images are being store, so it only has to use the file name to load it, get predictions and return the results back to *api*.

## Stress testing with *Locust*

The stress_test folder contains a Locust file that can be used to stress test the API. The results will vary according to each person's hardware.

## Getting feedback from users

The `/feedback` endpoint is there so the users can report using the service UI when a model prediction is wrong.The reported image path and the model prediction is stored in a plain text file inside the folder `/src/feedback` so we can access later to check those cases in which our Machine Learning model failed according to users.




## Install and run

To run the services using compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build -d
```

To stop the services:

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```

## Tests

### Integration end-to-end

You must have the full pipeline running and [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library installed. Then, from this project root folder run:

```
$ python tests/test_integration.py
```

### Modules

We make use of [multi-stage docker builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) so we can have into the same Dockerfile environments for testing and also for deploying our service.

#### Api

Run:

```bash
$ cd api/
$ docker build -t flask_api_test --progress=plain --target test .
```

You will only need to pay attention to the logs corresponding to the testing code which will look like this:

```bash
#10 [test 1/1] RUN ["pytest", "-v", "/src/tests"]
#10 sha256:707efc0d59d04744766193fe6873d212afc0f8e4b28d035a2d2e94b40826604f

```

You are good if all tests are passing.

#### Model

Same as api, run:

```bash
$ cd model/
$ docker build -t model_test --progress=plain --target test .
```
